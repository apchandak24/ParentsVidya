Why only Parents?
1. My desire to open up teaching for parents came from lack of any such service out there.
2. From our cultural tradition, parents focus on their children's life and forget to find enjoyment for themselves. Learning is enjoyment. It is something that should never end. They might never say, but they want to learn too.
3. This will give us chance to spend more time with our parents. Our parents would also get a chance to understand what we do in our day to day life.
4. Our parents are most accessible to us as we usually live with them, so you don't need to take out special time to go to a place to teach them.

Is it completely non-profit?
Right now, yes. It might spawn off sister projects which can turn into startup and if you would be interested in that, we would be open to it. We can also copy the same model for orphanage children or peers or underprivileged children. We are open to all those ideas But first, we need to get some substance in our work that we have right now in front of us.

What is the future? Any timeline that we have decided yet?
We would have some short term target and long term target. For say, we might do 100 hours August that might be announced soon. In the long run, we want it to spread within Nagpur and outside. It is a distributed form of teaching, so it can gain traction very easily. 

How do I start?  - Very very important question
1. You need to start form your home.  Once you have got their "yes", take a proper appointment of their time. Bring a laptop and 
smartphone with you and take the first session - See here
You can use the home internet via wifi and tether from you own phone. ParentsVidya will pay for your internet expenses. Take your job professionally and be on time. Be respectful and patient. Remember it is only natural that they will take time to learn. Don't rush if they don't understand. Learning one thing properly is better than learning a lot of things vaguely.

Questions on funding?
Most of the funding would come in the form of donations from people who are being taught. These donations would be used to buy laptops, internet devices, paying tutors and marketing expenses. Every tutor gets paid Rs.50 per hour. For the initial stage few of our members will invest some capital for laptops and tutors' hourly compensations. Every detail would be open and visible in google drive location : http://tinyurl.com/parentsvidya

Some common concerns:
1. My parents don't see the need to learn. What do I do?
It is our biggest challenge. Parents are sometime reluctant to learn from their children or state lack of time. Your ability to respectfully convince them would be your opportunity to show your wisdom. But if they still don't, go and check if your neighbors are interested.

2. I want to do this but I don't have time out of my studies/work/family.
If you ever want to get involved in volunteering on social issues, this is one of the most accessible thing you can do. And you will love it, because it is your parents! We don't have time to do a lot of things that we do, but we still do it with if we have passion and persistence.

3. I would like to be associated on manangement team or as volunteer, but cannot dedicate myself.
Every person on management team needs to be tutor (even if he/she teaches 1 hour per month). We would like to be associated with you even if you don't feel like tutoring, but to be on the team, you need to be a tutor.

4. Whom can I reach out to if I have questions?
Communicating via whatsapp on the group would be the best way. If you are not on whatsapp, we will have a facebook group too. If there is a question which is very specific to you, you can email me, or personally text me.
